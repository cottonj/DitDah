Ramblin Rose

Ramblin Rose, Ramblin Rose
Why you ramble, no one knows
Wild and wind-blown, that's how you've grown
Who can cling to a Ramblin Rose?

Ramble on, ramble on
When your ramblin days are gone
Who will love you with a love true
When your ramblin days are gone

Ramblin Rose, Ramblin Rose
Why I want you heaven knows
Though I love you with a love true
Who can cling to a Ramblin Rose?
